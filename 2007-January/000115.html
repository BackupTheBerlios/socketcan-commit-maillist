+.TH CAN 7 2006-11-28 &quot;Socket CAN&quot; &quot;Linux Programmer's Manual&quot;

+can \-  Linux CAN implementation
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.B #include &lt;linux/can.h&gt;
+.br
+.B #include &lt;linux/can/raw.h&gt;
+.br
+.B raw_socket = socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_RAW, CAN_RAW);
+.br
+.B bcm_socket = socket(PF_CAN, SOCK_DGRAM, CAN_BCM);
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+This is an implementation of the CAN protocols for Linux, based on the
+Berkeley socket API.  It consits of network device drivers for a
+number of CAN interface cards, a CAN core module which implements a
+new protocol family PF_CAN, and CAN protocol implementations which can
+be loaded as kernel modules.  The current GPL implementation covers
+two protocol modules, a raw socket interface and the broadcast manager
+(BCM) for efficiently handling periodically sent CAN messages.
