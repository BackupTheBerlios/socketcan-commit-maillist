New Revision: 739

Added:
   trunk/kernel/2.6/drivers/net/can/old/Kconfig
Modified:
   trunk/kernel/2.6/drivers/net/can/Kconfig
   trunk/kernel/2.6/drivers/net/can/Makefile
Log:
Moved Kconfig items for old drivers to old/Kconfig.
Updated makefile for old targets.
TODO: The Makefiles for mscan and ccan in the old path are not working.
The inclusion of old/Kconfig and the patch file generation is untested.
